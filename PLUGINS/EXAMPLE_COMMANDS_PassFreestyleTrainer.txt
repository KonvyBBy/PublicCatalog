# ===================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ===================================

# Plugin not working?
# 1. Check if enabled: pft enable
# 2. Verify mode is set: pft mode pass_trainer
# 3. Check difficulty: pft difficulty beginner
# 4. Look for error messages in console

# Not getting points?
# 1. Ensure you're meeting mode requirements
# 2. Check pass speed (must be 500+)
# 3. Verify you're airborne for aerial modes
# 4. Make sure plugin is enabled

# Commands not recognized?
# 1. Check spelling (case doesn't matter)
# 2. Ensure plugin loaded successfully
# 3. Look for startup message in console
# 4. Restart bot if needed


# ===================================
# CUSTOMIZATION
# ===================================

# To customize the plugin, edit these values in the .py file:

# Update rate (lines ~120-121):
# self.update_interval = 1.0 / 30.0  # Change 30 to adjust Hz

# Difficulty multipliers (lines ~134-139):
# "beginner": 1.0,     # Change multiplier
# "intermediate": 1.5,
# "advanced": 2.0,
# "pro": 2.5

# Pass speed threshold (line ~250):
# if ball_speed > 500:  # Change minimum pass speed

# Flip reset distance (line ~304):
# if distance < 150:  # Change detection range

# Air dribble distance (line ~333):
# if distance < 200:  # Change proximity requirement


# ===================================
